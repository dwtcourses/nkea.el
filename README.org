#+TITLE: nkea.el

Next Killer Email App.

nkea is a modest attempt at wrapping a [[https://superhuman.com/][superhuman]] like interface over [[https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/mu4e.html][mu4e]] and
[[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]].

** General idea
In nkea, we work with an /item/ defined by an actionable. You run a time bounded
session to go through the items one by one and take actions on them. In general,
the following actions are possible:

1. Snooze
2. Reply
3. Reply and snooze
4. Delete
5. Archive

All items are backed by an email (or email thread). Items are stored either in
Maildir directly or linked with a Org mode file for scheduling and general meta
information.
